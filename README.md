Hi, I'm new to programing and I'd like to learn a bunch of things in a small time frame (kinda imposible hehe), I'm a student at a univeristy and i study computer system maintenance. If there is any way in which you can help me I would be very thankful, every bit of help is highly apreciated :D I use Python, but I might start using other programing languages too.
